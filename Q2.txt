Java: Primarily an object-oriented programming (OOP) language. It focuses on objects and classes.
Java is a statically typed language, which means types are checked at compile time. It uses explicit type declarations.
Example:
java

int a = 2;
float k = 4.3f;
Increment/Decrement: Uses both pre and post increment/decrement operators (++, --).




Scala: A multi-paradigm language that supports both OOP and functional programming (FP). This dual support allows developers to use the best of both worlds.
Scala is also statically typed but has a more concise syntax due to type inference.
Example:
scala

val a = 2
val k = 4.3f
Increment/Decrement: Does not support ++ and -- operators.
Functional Programming: Encourages the use of immutable variables and functional programming constructs.
